# Google Coding Competitions archive

Google is soon (Jul 1, 2023) shutting down
[its _Coding Competitions_ platform](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/).

## Existing API client
https://github.com/Faylixe/googlecodejam-client

This is too old as it relies on https://code.google.com.

## Repository
An archive of problem statements is available on the
[gh-pages branch](https://github.com/ghuysmans/ccwg-archive/tree/gh-pages).

Files related to the analyses are too large for this platform (1.5 Go).
