Each contributor has a name and one or more\n    skills at a specific level $$$(0, 1, 2, ...)$$$. Not possessing a skill is\n    equivalent to possessing a skill at level 0.\n  </p>\n\n  <div class=\"hashcode-example-box\">\n    <p>For example, three contributors could have the following skills:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Anna: Python level 3</li>\n      <li>Bob: C++ level 3</li>\n      <li>Maria: HTML level 4, CSS level 6</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n  <img\n    alt=\"Three contributors and their skills, as described in the example above.\"\n    src=\"https://codejam.googleapis.com/dashboard/get_file/AQj_6U14XN7IXdTMu7d2t1dkomRQpv-Vm7s4aKkdFJ7e0VAyXQ-WXXaXuNNVAYw2ylGBLcWteLYTAI_YGwy1/contributors.png\"\n    title=\"Contributors and their skills.\"\n    class=\"hashcode-small-img\"\n  />\n\n  <h4>Projects</h4>\n\n  <p>There are $$$ M $$$ projects. Each project is described by:</p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>its name</li>\n\n    <li>\n      the duration of the project in days (how long it takes to complete a\n      project once it is started)\n    </li>\n\n    <li>the score awarded for completing the project</li>\n\n    <li>\n      the “best before” time in days – if the project last day of work is\n      strictly before the indicated day, it earns the full score. If it’s late\n      (that is, the project is still worked on during or after its \"best before\n      day\"), it gets one point less for each day it is late, but no less than\n      zero points. See also the example in the \"Assignments\" section below.\n    </li>\n\n    <li>a list of roles for contributors working on the project</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    Each project has one or more roles that need to be filled by contributors.\n    Each role requires one skill at a specific level, and can be filled by a\n    single contributor. Each contributor can fill\n    <strong>at most one role</strong> on a single project.\n  </p>\n\n  <div class=\"hashcode-example-box\">\n    <p>\n      For example, a project called \"WebServer\" could have the following roles:\n    </p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Role 0 requiring Python level 3</li>\n      <li>Role 1 requiring HTML level 1</li>\n      <li>Role 2 requiring CSS level 5</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n  <img\n    alt=\"The 3 roles that need to be filled for project WebServer, as described in the example above.\"\n    src=\"https://codejam.googleapis.com/dashboard/get_file/AQj_6U0RAv3nIb7NTcbJb9AitndCi5IIbymAY9mPPFvcCMctQ6S_UOcJacHybdR2o29Na9gRyUQ/roles.png\"\n    title=\"Roles that need to be filled for project WebServer.\"\n    class=\"hashcode-small-img\"\n  />\n\n  <h4>Filling roles and mentorship</h4>\n\n  <p>\n    A contributor can be assigned to a project for a specific role (at most one\n    role in a single project), if they either:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>have the skill at the required level or higher; or</li>\n\n    <li>\n      have the skill at exactly one level below the required level,\n      <strong\n        >only if another contributor on the same project (assigned to another\n        role), has this skill at the required level or higher</strong\n      >. In this case, the contributor will be mentored by their colleague :)\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    One contributor can mentor multiple people at once, including for the same\n    skill. A contributor can mentor and be mentored by other contributors at the\n    same time.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Not possessing a skill is equivalent to possessing a skill at level 0. So a\n    contributor can work on a project and be assigned to a role with requirement\n    C++ level 1 if they don’t know any C++, provided that somebody else on the\n    team\n    <strong>knows C++ at level 1 or higher</strong>.\n  </p>\n\n  <div class=\"hashcode-example-box\">\n    <p>For example:</p>\n    <p>\n      For the project WebServer above we could make the following assignments:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Role 0 (requires Python level 3) is assigned to Anna (Python level 3).\n    </p>\n    <ul class=\"hashcode-no-style-list\">\n      <li>☑️ Anna has the same level in Python as required.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>Role 1 (requires HTML level 1) is assigned to Bob (C++ level 3).</p>\n\n    <ul class=\"hashcode-no-style-list\">\n      <li>\n        ⚠ Bob has level 0 in HTML. Since his level is only one below required,\n        he can be assigned, but must be mentored by another contributor who\n        knows HTML at level 1 or above.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>\n      Role 2 (requires CSS level 5) is assigned to Maria (HTML level 4, CSS\n      level 6)\n    </p>\n    <ul class=\"hashcode-no-style-list\">\n      <li>☑️ Maria has a higher level than the one required for CSS.</li>\n      <li>☑️ Maria can mentor Bob on HTML since she has HTML level 4.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n  <h4>Assignments</h4>\n\n  <p>\n    Each contributor can start working on day 0 and can be working on at most\n    one project at the same time. Once the work on a project starts, its\n    contributors will be working on it the number of days equal to its duration\n    and then become available to work on other projects.\n  </p>\n\n  <div class=\"hashcode-example-box\">\n    <p>\n      For example, if the project WebServer has duration of 7 days and starts on\n      day 0, the contributors assigned to it will be working on it during: day\n      0, day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4, day 5 and day 6. On day 7 the project is\n      already completed. Contributors assigned to it can work on another project\n      on day 7.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n  <h4>Learning</h4>\n\n  <p>\n    Completing a project is a learning opportunity, especially for the\n    contributors working on the edge of their existing abilities! When each\n    project is completed:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      contributors working in roles where the required skill level was equal or\n      higher than their current level improve their skill level by one level\n    </li>\n    <li>other contributors keep their skill level</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    Note that <strong>mentoring</strong> someone doesn’t increase the level of\n    the skill for the mentor.\n  </p>\n\n  <div class=\"hashcode-example-box\">\n    <p>For example:</p>\n    <p>In the assignments above:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Anna improves Python skill to level 4;</li>\n      <li>Bob improves HTML skill to level 1;</li>\n      <li>\n        Maria improves neither the CSS skill (because Maria’s CSS is already at\n        a level higher than required) nor the HTML skill (because her role\n        required CSS, not HTML).\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n  <h3>Input data sets</h3>\n\n  \n  <a name=\"inputDataDownloadBox\"></a>\n  <div class=\"test-data-download-wrapper\" style=\"min-width: 100%;\">\n    <div class=\"test-data-download-header\">\n      <div class=\"test-data-download-header-text\">Input Data</div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"test-data-download-content\">\n      <a href=\"https://codejam.googleapis.com/dashboard/get_file/AQj_6U1Es6-vHagXlsxSng57W4M5gQq34nKJcQFc9IKml5itMN2HTyDlnegppac4Q4ZLHE20Zk5avjSn9g/input_data.zip?dl=1\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <span class=\"material-icons\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">save_alt</span>\n        <span style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">Full input (zipped)</span>\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"https://codejam.googleapis.com/dashboard/get_file/AQj_6U0E9LmUY2PMlmZ5aLQfzxzRvRrEbIxD9CXdCUvXuOg_9g1aTolEMq60fAHuEd3aHJ3OeIws7OZvTEh99Lkp/a_an_example.in.txt?dl=1\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <span class=\"material-icons\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">save_alt</span>\n        <span style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">A - An example</span>\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"https://codejam.googleapis.com/dashboard/get_file/AQj_6U1uCkSL5eNP-K_gPep840Fkhdd60ww6HBb1WzT6Km9AlUoF0LnS-RXfFJj0kUoPJIZZ7pynHgzZ282k2WA3OnDEg5DW8k8/b_better_start_small.in.txt?dl=1\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <span class=\"material-icons\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">save_alt</span>\n        <span style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">B - Better start small</span>\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"https://codejam.googleapis.com/dashboard/get_file/AQj_6U3Qx1hcH6zAVIO2bSg4tx2EWeNB-Cj8uwonb0PgLB73EkvZunxLFAAUriXYpD5MAUd6y7XLmiVbnDFBwSUhWUHb/c_collaboration.in.txt?dl=1\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <span class=\"material-icons\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">save_alt</span>\n        <span style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">C - Collaboration</span>\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"https://codejam.googleapis.com/dashboard/get_file/AQj_6U2Bt-p3lFDwmNCSxXG7ISeNKaXIntgqh5Q7unu0OKjKsLWV-4gATEnbgOVlyixiu1iOTFRzd4BsWpniG7Q3BpRycw/d_dense_schedule.in.txt?dl=1\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <span class=\"material-icons\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">save_alt</span>\n        <span style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">D - Dense schedule</span>\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"https://codejam.googleapis.com/dashboard/get_file/AQj_6U3lTiXQ0F53lNj4_071LOrZV_GWEQeRrjaTxqVds1KtX6EuW79g8nXj4kKwlh1101pJ6AHEEIBI98c3u7ChvhjRuBh194I/e_exceptional_skills.in.txt?dl=1\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <span class=\"material-icons\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">save_alt</span>\n        <span style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">E - Exceptional skills</span>\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"https://codejam.googleapis.com/dashboard/get_file/AQj_6U06I-YzTyrccx2tOQ8yvUu_gqgZoPfyUY4W_VTd4Uak8y9zkArGIoiT2UlZaBwcGM0lw8MzTyfCE9kc4rhglvZpfY8EDwI/f_find_great_mentors.in.txt?dl=1\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <span class=\"material-icons\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">save_alt</span>\n        <span style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">F - Find great mentors</span>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n\n  <h4>File format</h4>\n\n  <p>\n    Each input data set is provided in a plain text file.
