The tolerance values can be used to bound the range of the for statements.<br>\n2. In that case, once R and G are fixed, there’s no need to look at every possible value of B; you can instead figure out the number of valid values directly.<br>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<pre>\ndef solve2(maxvalue, tolerance):\n  total = 0\n  for r in range(0, maxvalue+1):\n    for g in range(max(r-tolerance, 0), min(r+tolerance, maxvalue)+1):\n      minb = max(r-tolerance, g-tolerance, 0)\n      maxb = min(r+tolerance, g+tolerance, maxvalue)\n      total += (maxb - minb + 1)\n  return total\n</pre>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut this is far too slow for the second Large input, in which K can range as high as 2 billion! How can we proceed?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs is often the case in programming contests, the specified limits provide a clue. There’s no way to iterate over 2 billion values in time, so there must be a formulaic element to the answer. Indeed, if you look at the numbers of valid values beginning with each possible value for R, a pattern emerges. For example, consider this data for K = 10, V = 3:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>R</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Valid colors&nbsp;</td><td>16&nbsp;</td><td>23&nbsp;</td><td>30&nbsp;</td><td>37&nbsp;</td><td>37&nbsp;</td><td>37&nbsp;</td><td>37&nbsp;</td><td>37&nbsp;</td><td>30&nbsp;</td><td>23&nbsp;</td><td>16&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce we’re at least V away from either end of the range of possible values for R, the number of valid colors is always the same! This makes sense because the number of valid colors is determined by an interaction between V and the boundaries of the range. And once we’re far enough away from the boundaries, that number depends only on V. Moreover, the problem is symmetric. The situation at the beginning of the range is exactly the same as at the end of the range. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nThese observations suggest a modification that will work for the second Large input:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<pre>\ndef solve3(k, v):\n  total = 0\n  for r in range(0, v+1):\n    subtotal = 0\n    for g in range(max(r-v, 0), min(r+v, k)+1):\n      minb = max(r-v, g-v, 0)\n      maxb = min(r+v, g+v, k)\n      subtotal += (maxb - minb + 1)\n    if r == v:\n      total *= 2 # take advantage of symmetry\n      total += subtotal * (k - 2*v + 1)\n    else:\n      total += subtotal\n  return total\n</pre>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne of our contestants went even farther than that!

As he puts it: “I’m not an ambi-turner.”\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne way to approach the problem is to construct all possible paths using, for example, a breadth-first search. Since the answer for a 10x10 grid is only 48620, this works fine for the Small data set, but it’s too slow for the Large. Googlander can walk 32247603683100 paths in a 25 x 25 grid, and that’s just too many paths to keep track of! So we need a better way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn important observation is that once Googlander leaves the line of cells he’s currently walking along (without loss of generality, we’ll say it’s a column) by turning right, it’s impossible for him to return to it (or to any cell in the grid beyond the row into which he turns). This means that once he has taken his first step out of the column, he is in a new instance of the same problem, but smaller and rotated 90 degrees to the right. This suggests a recursive solution that accounts for the fact that he can make his turn anywhere in the column:\n</p>\n\n<p>\nanswer(R, C) = sum from i = 1 to R of answer(C-1, i)<br>\nanswer(1, anything) = answer(anything, 1) = 1\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf you use memoization to avoid solving the same subproblem more than once, this recursive strategy is fast enough for the Large data set.

We leave it as an exercise to the reader to dig into that relationship.\n</p> ","id":"0000000000050ed3","statement":"<h3>Problem</h3>\n<p>\nEric Googlander is a fashion model who performs by walking around on a stage made of squares that form a grid with <b>R</b> rows and <b>C</b> columns. He begins at the leftmost bottom square, facing toward the top edge of the stage, and he will perform by making a series of moves. Googlander knows only the following two moves:<br>\n<br>\n1. Take one step forward in the direction he is currently facing<br>\n<br>\n2. Make a single 90 degree turn to the right, then take one step forward in the new direction he is facing following the turn<br>\n<br>\n(Note that Googlander does not know how to make a 90 degree <i>left</i> turn.)<br>\n<br>\nIf a move would take Googlander off of the stage or onto a square he has already visited, that move is <i>unfashionable</i>. Whenever Googlander is in a position for which neither of the two possible moves is unfashionable, he is free to choose either move (independently of any other choices he has made in the past), but he must choose one of them. Whenever one of the possible moves he can make is unfashionable, he must make the other move. If at any point both of the possible moves are unfashionable, the show immediately ends without Googlander making another move.

problem was a somewhat contrived mathematical interpretation of a popular Internet meme. We know that it was a little awkward to have outputs with hundreds of exclamation points per line, but we couldn't resist. (The definition of multifactorials in the problem is real, but multifactorials don’t come up too often in practice!)\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLike I/O Error, this is mostly an implementation problem. There are only 9000 different multifactorials of 9000. You can calculate them all, find how many digits are in each one, and choose the one with the largest number of digits that is still smaller than the number of digits in the opponent’s power level. But for the Large data set, most of those multifactorials are far too large to fit in the standard data types found in languages like C++ and Java. There were several workarounds for this:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n1. Use a language extension like Java’s BigInteger that handles large numbers. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n2. Use a language like Python that naturally handles arbitrarily large integers.\n</p> \n\n<p>\n3. Take advantage of a useful programming contest trick: to multiply large numbers without overflowing the result, you can instead add the logarithms of those numbers and then raise the logarithm base to that power. In our case, since we only want the number of digits, you can use log base 10 and then take the ceiling of the sum. This method brings about the usual danger of small errors introduced by floating-point addition, but no multifactorial of 9000 is close enough to a power of 10 for this to pose a problem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHere’s a sample Python solution that demonstrates the log addition method.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<pre>\nimport math\n\ndef multifactorial9000(num_exc):\n  ans = math.log10(9000)\n  curr = 9000\n  curr -= num_exc\n  while curr &gt; 0:\n    ans += math.log10(curr)\n    curr -= num_exc\n  return math.ceil(ans)\n\n# from number of exclamation points to number of digits\ndigits = [-1]*9001\nfor num_exc in range(1, 9001):\n  digits[num_exc] = multifactorial9000(num_exc)\n\ndef solve(numdigits):\n  i = 1\n  while i &lt;= 9000 and numdigits &lt;= digits[i]:\n    i += 1\n  if i &gt; 9000:\n    return \"...\"\n  return \"IT'S OVER 9000\" + \"!\"*i\n\nt = int(raw_input().strip())\nfor case in range(1, t+1):\n  d = int(raw_input().strip())\n  print \"Case #\" + str(case) + \": \" + str(solve(d))\n</pre>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBy the way, the title is a subtle pun: the problem revolves around numbers of digits, which are closely related to powers of 10.\n</p>","id":"0000000000050fec","statement":"<h3>Problem</h3>\n<p>\nA <i>multifactorial</i> -- that is, a number N followed by some nonzero number E of exclamation points -- is defined as the product of all <b>positive</b> numbers (N - K*E) for which K is a nonnegative integer. Normal factorials meet the definition of multifactorials, for example:<br>\n<br>\n5! = 5 * (5-1) * (5-2) * (5-3) * (5-4) = 120<br>\n<br>\nHere are the other multifactorials of 5:<br>\n<br>\n5!! equals 5 * (5-2) * (5-4) = 15<br>\n<br>\n5!!! equals 5 * (5-3) = 10<br>\n<br>\n5!!!! equals 5 * (5-4) = 5<br>\n<br>\n5 followed by five or more !s = 5<br>\n<br>\n5 with no exclamation points is not considered a multifactorial.<br>\n<br>\nThe villainous Anima and her underling Minera love three things: multifactorials, yelling \"IT'S OVER 9000\" followed by some number of exclamation points, and going around the universe looking for people to fight.<br>\n<br>\nWhen Anima and Minera encounter a potential opponent, Anima asks Minera to use her scanner device to determine the opponent's power level, which is always a positive integer that does not begin with any leading zeroes. Today, the display on Minera's scanner is blurry, and she can only tell Anima the number of digits <b>D</b> in the opponent's power level, and not what any of those digits are.<br>\n<br>\nAnima wants to yell IT'S OVER followed by a multifactorial of 9000 to accurately describe the opponent's power level. She will never yell something that might not be true, and she will never use more exclamation points than she needs to. For example, if <b>D</b> = 31682, Anima can't yell IT'S OVER 9000!, because she knows that 9000! also has 31682 digits and the opponent's power level might be a 31682-digit number that is less than or equal to 9000!. However, since 9000!! has fewer than 31682 digits, she can be confident that the opponent's power level is greater than 9000!!, so IT'S OVER 9000!! is guaranteed to be true. Although the opponent's power level is also definitely greater than 9000!!!, 9000!!!!, and so on, she won't use more exclamation points than she needs to. So, in this example, she will yell IT'S OVER 9000!!<br>\n<br>\nIf there is no multifactorial of 9000 that is definitely less than the opponent's power level, Anima will remain dramatically silent. We represent dramatic silence as an ellipsis: <code>...</code><br>\n<br>\nWhat should Anima say?\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <b>T</b>. <b>T</b> lines follow. Each contains a positive integer <b>D</b>, the number of digits in an opponent's power level.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output one line containing \"Case #x: y\", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is either <code>...</code> if Anima must remain silent, or <code>IT'S OVER 9000</code> followed by some positive number of exclamation points.
