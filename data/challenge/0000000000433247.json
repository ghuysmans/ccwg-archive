It also firmly demonstrates that its author still lives in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=all+your+base\" target=\"_blank\">A.D. 2001</a>.</p>\n<p>In this problem our job is to read a series of symbols and interpret them as digits of a number in some base.  In order to <i>minimize</i> the number, we'll want to use the smallest base possible.  We can check how many different characters show up in the number; if that number of characters is <b>k</b>, then we can work in base <code>max(<b>k</b>,2)</code> (base 1 is not allowed).  From there, it's simply a matter of assigning values from 0 to <b>k</b> to all of the characters.  We can't start with a 0, so we should make the first digit a 1; and after that, simply assign the lowest number available to characters from left to right.  In that way, \"ab2ac999\" becomes \"10213444\" in base 5, or 85499 seconds.</p>\n<p>The following is a brief solution in Python:</p>\n<pre>\nimport sys\n\nN = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\nfor qw in range(1, N+1):\n  print 'Case #%d:' % qw,\n\n  num = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n  values = {num[0]: 1}\n  for c in num:\n    if c not in values:\n      sz = len(values)\n      if sz == 1:\n        values[c] = 0\n      else:\n        values[c] = sz\n  result = 0\n  base = max(len(values), 2)\n  for c in num:\n    result *= base\n    result += values[c]\n  print result\n</pre>\n\n<p>One final note: on our official <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/google-code/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\">Google Group</a>, user Damien pointed out the following:</p>\n\n<p>\"The first example case in All Your Base implies the alien language uses a left-right notation.

They wrote a message in a cryptic language, and next to it they wrote a series of symbols.

We've decided that each symbol indicates one digit, but we aren't sure what each digit means or what base the aliens are using.  For example, if they wrote \"ab2ac999\", they could have meant \"31536000\" in base 10 -- exactly one year -- or they could have meant \"12314555\" in base 6 -- 398951 seconds, or about four and a half days.
